## Professional Interests

I'm particularly interested in the convergence of software engineering and data science—where elegant code meets statistical rigor. I believe the future of software development lies in systems that not only function efficiently but also provide deep insights through intelligent data processing.

**Research Areas:**
- Distributed Systems Architecture
- Real-Time Data Processing
- Machine Learning Pipeline Integration
- Performance Engineering

## Collaboration

I'm always interested in discussing innovative projects, particularly those that challenge conventional approaches to data architecture or push the boundaries of full-stack development. Feel free to reach out for collaboration on meaningful technical challenges.
